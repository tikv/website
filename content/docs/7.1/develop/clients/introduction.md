TiKV offers two APIs that you can interact with:

| API           | Description                                                                    | Atomicity     | Usage scenarios                                                                      |
|:------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |:------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Raw           | A low-level key-value API to interact directly with individual key-value pairs | Single key    | Your application requires low latency and does not involve distributed transactions. |
| Transactional | A high-level key-value API to provide ACID semantics.                          | Multiple keys | Your application requires distributed transactions.                                  |

{{< warning >}}
To use both the raw and transactional APIs in the same cluster, please enable [API V2](../../../concepts/explore-tikv-features/api-v2).
