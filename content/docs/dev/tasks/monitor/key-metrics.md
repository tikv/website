If your TiKV cluster is deployed using Ansible or Docker Compose, the monitoring system is deployed at the same time. For more details, see [Overview of the TiKV Monitoring Framework](https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/reference/key-monitoring-metrics/overview-dashboard/).

The Grafana dashboard is divided into a series of sub-dashboards which include Overview, PD, TiKV, and so on. You can use various metrics to help you diagnose the cluster.

But you can also deploy your own Grafana server to monitor the TiKV cluster, especially when you are going to use TiKV without TiDB. This document provides a detailed description of key metrics so that you can monitor the Prometheus metrics you are interested in.

## Key metrics description
