TiKV uses [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/) as its underlying storage engine for storing both [Raft logs](architecture#raft) and KV (key-value) pairs.

{{< info >}}
RocksDB was chosen for TiKV because it provides a highly customizable persistent key-value store that can be tuned to run in a variety of production environments, including pure memory, Flash, hard disks, or HDFS, it supports various compression algorithms, and it provides solid tools for production support and debugging.

TiKV creates two RocksDB instances on each Node:

* A `rocksdb` instance that stores most TiKV data
* A `raftdb` that stores [Raft logs](architecture#raft) and has a single column family called `raftdb.defaultcf`

The `rocksdb` instance has three column families:

Column family | Purpose
:-------------|:-------
`rocksdb.defaultcf` | Stores actual KV pairs for TiKV
`rocksdb.writecf` | Stores commit information in the MVCC model

RocksDB can be configured on a per-column-family basis. Here's an example:

```toml
[rocksdb]
max-background-jobs = 8
```
