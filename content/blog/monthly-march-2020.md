In this unprecedented global situation, we hope you can all keep a positive attitude and stay healthy.  

Let’s take a look at what we have achieved in March!

## News

TiKV has finished [a third-party security assessment](https://tikv.org/blog/tikv-pass-security-audit/)! This assessment of the TiKV scope, commissioned by CNCF and executed by Cure53 in early 2020, concludes with generally positive results. The full report is available [here](https://tikv.org/blog/TiKV-Security-Audit.pdf).

The TiKV community held the first-ever community meeting on March 26, 2020. Liu Tang ([@siddontang](https://github.com/siddontang)), one of our maintainers, kicked off the meeting, and the community manager, Calvin Weng ([@dcalvin](https://github.com/dcalvin)) shared about recent updates on community governance and membership. Also, a demo of [unified thread pool](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HWC9SmthBdbp633wLCtORRvCwQqAfJ8zWkjr82O_gN0/edit#slide=id.g71ef919454_1_5), a thread pool in Rust to improve TiKV’s performance in allocating and scheduling resources, was presented by Yilin Chen ([@sticnarf](https://github.com/sticnarf)) at the end of the meeting. In case you missed it, the recording video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDvakA-efA&feature=youtu.be) and the meeting notes are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CWUAkBrcm9KPclAu8fWHZzByZ0yhsQdRggnEdqtRMQ8/edit#heading=h.ut5w82fnx9bc).

We have two new TiKV maintainers - Daobing Li ([@lidaobing](https://github.com/lidaobing)) from JD Cloud & AI and Fu Chen ([@fredchenbj](https://github.com/fredchenbj)) from Yidian Zixun. Congratulations! We look forward to working with them. The nominating PRs are here:

*   [Add Daobing Li as TiKV Maintainer](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/7237)
*   [Add Fu Chen as TiKV maintainer](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/7259)

The 2020 TiKV & [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) projects are going smoothly. Mentors, Yi Wu ([@yiwu-arbug](https://github.com/yiwu-arbug)) and Wei Liu ([@Little-Wallace](https://github.com/Little-Wallace)), had a video call with students on Mar 27 to help them learn details about these projects. Students have already submitted their proposals to GSoC. Good luck to them and we look forward to seeing their great achievements by the end of summer. 

CNCF has confirmed the new event dates for [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2020](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) and TiKV speaking sessions are scheduled on August 15 and 16. We keep fingers crossed for those fighting against the Novel Coronavirus and expect to see you in TiKV speaking sessions by mid-summer.

## Reading materials

[@YangKeao](https://github.com/YangKeao) wrote [Quickly Find Rust Program Bottlenecks Online Using a Go Tool](https://pingcap.com/blog/quickly-find-rust-program-bottlenecks-online-using-a-go-tool/) to introduce the experience of using the Go tool pprof to visualize TiKV’s profiling data.

In the recap of [RocksDB in TiKV](https://tikv.org/blog/rocksdb-in-tikv/) in a 2017 meetup, [@siddontang](https://github.com/siddontang) shared about how the friendship between RocksDB and TiKV came into being and how it has developed. 

## Notable PRs

[@overvenus](https://github.com/overvenus) supported encryption at rest in [#6990](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/6990).

[@zhangjinpeng1987](https://github.com/zhangjinpeng1987) calculated CPU quota and memory limit in the container environment in [#7074](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/7074), and automatically adjusted related configurations in TiKV.

[@yiwu-arbug](https://github.com/yiwu-arbug) added utilities to enable AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) in Kubernetes in [#7201](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/7201).

[@loxp](https://github.com/loxp) added [swagger](https://swagger.io/) supports for API in [#2276](https://github.com/pingcap/pd/pull/2276), making API easy to use. 

[@innerr](https://github.com/innerr) and [@youjiali1995](https://github.com/youjiali1995) implemented pipelined pessimistic locks in [#6984](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/6984). Pipelining can improve performance in pessimistic transactions.

## Notable issues

**Help wanted issues (mentoring available)**

[@zhangjinpeng1987](https://github.com/zhangjinpeng1987) suggested improving the test coverage of the components/codec module, the test coverage of components/raftstore module and the test coverage of the components/tidb_query_datatypes module separately in [#7186](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/7186), [#7191](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/7191) and [#7192](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/7192).

[@breeswish](https://github.com/breeswish) created issue [#7039](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/7039), requesting a feature to optimize the coprocessor's analytical performance.

**Call for participation**

[@MyonKeminta](https://github.com/MyonKeminta) opened issue [#7153](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/7153), requesting to avoid incorrect "engine" label to distinguish nodes with different engines. [@overvenus](https://github.com/overvenus) and [@disksing](https://github.com/disksing) presented their opinions on this issue; what is yours?

[@5kbpers](https://github.com/5kbpers) suggested in [#7113](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/7113) to support to delay the GC for delete record to relax the limitation of the GC interval. [@MyonKeminta](https://github.com/MyonKeminta) agreed with [@5kbpers](https://github.com/5kbpers). What do you think?
