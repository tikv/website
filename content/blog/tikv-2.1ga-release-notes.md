# TiKV 2.1 GA Release Notes

On November 30, 2018, TiKV 2.1 GA is released. See the following updates in this release. Compared with TiKV 2.0, this release has great improvements in stability, performance, and usability.

## Coprocessor

- Add more built-in functions
- [Add Coprocessor `ReadPool` to improve the concurrency in processing the requests](https://github.com/tikv/rfcs/blob/master/text/2017-12-22-read-pool.md)
- Fix the time function parsing issue and the time zone related issues
- Optimize the memory usage for pushdown aggregation computing

## Transaction

- Optimize the read logic and memory usage of MVCC to improve the performance of the scan operation and the performance of full table scan is 1 time better than that in TiDB 2.0
- Fold the continuous Rollback records to ensure the read performance
- [Add the `UnsafeDestroyRange` API to support to collecting space for the dropping table/index](https://github.com/tikv/rfcs/blob/master/text/2018-08-29-unsafe-destroy-range.md)
- Separate the GC module to reduce the impact on write
- Add the `upper bound` support in the `kv_scan` command

## Raftstore

- Improve the snapshot writing process to avoid RocksDB stall
- [Add the `LocalReader` thread to process read requests and reduce the delay for read requests](https://github.com/tikv/rfcs/pull/17)
- [Support `BatchSplit` to avoid large Region brought by large amounts of write](https://github.com/tikv/rfcs/pull/6)
- Support `Region Split` according to statistics to reduce the I/O overhead
- Support `Region Split` according to the number of keys to improve the concurrency of index scan
- Improve the Raft message process to avoid unnecessary delay brought by `Region Split`
- Enable the `PreVote` feature by default to reduce the impact of network isolation on services

## Storage Engine

- Fix the `CompactFiles`bug in RocksDB and reduce the impact on importing data using Lightning
- Upgrade RocksDB to v5.15 to fix the possible issue of snapshot file corruption
- Improve `IngestExternalFile` to avoid the issue that flush could block write

## tikv-ctl

- [Add the `ldb` command to diagnose RocksDB related issues](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/master/docs/tools/tikv-control.md#ldb-command)
- The `compact` command supports specifying whether to compact data in the bottommost level
