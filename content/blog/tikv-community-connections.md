A few months ago at [TiDB DevCon](https://pingcap.com/community-cn/devcon2019/) we talked about how we'd be opening new TiKV community forums & a community chat. We're very happy to announce we're releasing [forum.tikv.org](http://forum.tikv.org/) for forums, and [tikv-wg slack](https://join.slack.com/t/tikv-wg/shared_invite/enQtNTUyODE4ODU2MzI0LTgzZDQ3NzZlNDkzMGIyYjU1MTA0NzIwMjFjODFiZjA0YjFmYmQyOTZiNzNkNzg1N2U1MDdlZTIxNTU5NWNhNjk) for chat.

<!--more-->

These spaces are designed so our community can discuss and share together. During our planning we realized that a synchronous space such as Slack or Discord offers  a good place for ephemeral *conversations*, *discussions*, and *troubleshooting*, while spaces such as forums or Discourse offer a semi-permanent spaces for sharing *articles*, *stories*, and *guides*.

This space isn't just for TiKV! You'll also find topics for some of TiKVs dependencies as well: [`raft-rs`](https://github.com/pingcap/raft-rs), [`gRPC-rs`](https://github.com/pingcap/grpc-rs/), [`rust-prometheus`](https://github.com/pingcap/rust-prometheus/), and [`fail-rs`](https://github.com/pingcap/fail-rs).

As with all TiKV project spaces, please follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) with us so we can foster a vibrant, accepting, worldwide community.

The spaces are still quite young and in continuous evolution, but we'd love to have you join us and share.
