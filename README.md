# The TiKV website

This repo houses the assets used to build the [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv) website available at https://tikv.org.

## Publishing

The site is published automatically by [Netlify](https://netlify.com) whenever changes are pushed to the `master` branch. You do not need to manually publish or manage the site deployment.

## Running the site locally

To run the site locally, you'll need to install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) (in particular the [extended](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) version).

You can alternatively use the provided `Dockerfile` via:

```bash
$ make docker-image
$ make docker-serve
```

If the locally website is running, the below message should be show.
```markdown
docker run --rm --interactive --tty --volume `pwd`:/home/builder/build -p 13131:13131 tikv-website sh -c "yarn && make serve-production"
yarn install v1.16.0
